## 3 - With Plotly

1. - App.js: comment in React 
`{/* Render the current temperatura if no specific date is picked */}`

2. - App.js: 
`
There is one small user experience improvement we could do. When switching to a new city, the text persists because this.state.selected.temp still references the old dataâ€”in reality want to show the current temperature though!

To fix this, we set selected back to the default values in our fetchData method when the request has returned data:
`
```
self.setState({
  data: body,
  dates: dates,
  temps: temps,
  selected: {
    date: '',
    temp: null
  }
});
```
